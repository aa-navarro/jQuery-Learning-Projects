									</div><!--clearfix question question-159-->
			
							<div class="answer accordion-hide">
			
								<p>There are three elements to qualifying for COBRA benefits. COBRA establishes specific criteria for plans, qualified beneficiaries, and qualifying events:</p>
								<p><strong>Plan Coverage</strong> &#8211; Group health plans for employers with 20 or more employees on more than 50 percent of its typical business days in the previous calendar year are 									subject to COBRA. Both full and part-time employees are counted to determine whether a plan is subject to COBRA. Each part-time employee counts as a fraction of an employee, with the 											fraction equal to the number of hours that the part-time employee worked divided by the hours an employee must work to be considered full time.</p>
						
								<p><strong>Qualified Beneficiaries</strong> &#8211; A qualified beneficiary generally is an individual covered by a group health plan on the day before a qualifying event who is an employee, 									the employee&#8217;s spouse, or an employee&#8217;s dependent child. In certain cases, a retired employee, the retired employee&#8217;s spouse, and the retired employee&#8217;s dependent 										children may be qualified beneficiaries. In addition, any child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during the period of COBRA coverage is considered a qualified 											beneficiary. Agents, independent contractors, and directors who participate in the group health plan may also be qualified beneficiaries.</p>
						
								<p><strong>Qualifying Events</strong> &#8211; Qualifying events are certain events that would cause an individual to lose health coverage. The type of qualifying event will determine who the 									qualified beneficiaries are and the amount of time that a plan must offer the health coverage to them under COBRA. A plan, at its discretion, may provide longer periods of continuation 										coverage.</p>
						
								<p><strong>Qualifying Events for Employees:</strong></p>
					
								<ul>
									<li>Voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than gross misconduct</li>
									<li>Reduction in the number of hours of employment</li>		
								</ul>

							<p><strong>Qualifying Events for Spouses:</strong></p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee&#8217;s employment for any reason other than gross misconduct</li>
									<li>Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee</li>
									<li>Covered employee&#8217;s becoming entitled to Medicare</li>
									<li>Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee</li>
									<li>Death of the covered employee</li>
								</ul>
						
							<p><strong>Qualifying Events for Dependent Children:</strong></p>
						
								<ul>
									<li>Loss of dependent child status under the plan rules</li>
									<li>Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee&#8217;s employment for any reason other than gross misconduct</li>
									<li>Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee</li>
									<li>Covered employee&#8217;s becoming entitled to Medicare</li>
									<li>Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee</li>
									<li>Death of the covered employee</li>

										<span class="expand">[+]</span><div>What is COBRA continuation health coverage?</div>
							
									</div><!--clearfix question question-158-->
					
							<div class="answer accordion-hide">
	
								<p>Congress passed the landmark Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) health benefit provisions in 1986. The law amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the 										Internal Revenue Code and the Public Health Service Act to provide continuation of group health coverage that otherwise might be terminated.</p>
